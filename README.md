# 🚀 My DSA Journey (JavaScript Focus)

This repository documents my dedicated journey to mastering **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** using **JavaScript**, along with commonly asked JS interview questions. Below is a structured timeline of what I have completed and what this repository covers.

---

## 📅 **Phase 1 — 30 Days of JavaScript DSA**

A strong foundation built by solving problems daily for 30 days.

### Topics Covered:

* Arrays (Basics → Advanced)
* Strings
* Two Pointers
* Sliding Window
* Sorting Concepts
* Recursion Basics
* Hashmaps & Frequency Maps
* Stack & Basic Implementation Patterns

### Types of Problems Solved:

* Easy and Medium-level coding questions
* Pattern-based problems
* Common coding test-style questions

---

## 🔥 **Phase 2 — Blind 75 (Arrays + Hashmaps)**

Focused on the most frequently asked interview questions.

### Arrays — Completed Problems Include:

* Two Sum
* Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
* Product of Array Except Self
* Maximum Subarray
* Contains Duplicate
* 3Sum
* Merge Intervals
* Search in Rotated Sorted Array
* Container With Most Water
* And many more...

### Hashmaps — Completed Problems Include:

* Group Anagrams
* Valid Anagram
* Top K Frequent Elements
* Longest Consecutive Sequence
* Subarray Sum Equals K
* Longest Repeating Character Replacement
* Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

---

## 🧠 **Phase 3 — Commonly Asked JavaScript Interview Questions**

Deep dive into core JS concepts frequently asked during frontend interviews.

### Topics Covered:

* Closures
* Event Loop & Call Stack
* Hoisting
* "this" keyword
* Prototypal Inheritance
* Async JavaScript (Promises, async/await)
* Debouncing / Throttling
* Currying
* Deep vs Shallow Copy
* Array & Object methods
* Higher Order Functions

### Practical Coding Questions Solved:

* Custom Promise implementation
* Polyfills for map, filter, reduce
* Implementing debounce & throttle
* Call, Apply, Bind polyfills
* Custom event emitter
* Memoization function
